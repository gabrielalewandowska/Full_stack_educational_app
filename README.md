# Educational App

A group project for my software development course at CodeClan.<br/>
You can view the app here: https://animals-of-the-world.herokuapp.com/

## Project Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts.

## MVP
- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way.
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content.

## Our project

We decided to create an interactive app which would help children learn more about the animals of the world. In order to do that we created our own API with quiz questions and information on animals living in various habitats. Since we had only six days to finish the project we covered only two types of habitat but we tried to write our code in a way which would enable us to easily extend the app in future.

## My part

I created more than half of our API and wrote the JavaScript and CSS code which renders the whole quiz section in the browser. My JS code randomises the order of questions and answers displayed and makes sure that none of them appears twice. My CSS code uses FlexBox to position and scale elements on the webpage.

## If I had more time...

I would like to refactor the code to make it more DRY and flexible.
